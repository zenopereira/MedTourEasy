With the explosion in fitness tracker popularity, runners all of the world are collecting data withgadgets (smartphones, watches, etc.) to keep themselves motivated. They look for answers toquestions like:
•How fast, long, and intense was my run today?
•Have I succeeded with my training goals?
•Am I progressing?

# MedTourEasy-Data-Analysis
Forecasting blood supply is a serious and recurrent problem for blood collection managers.In this Project, you will work with data collected from the donor database of Blood TransfusionService Center.  The dataset, obtained from the Machine Learning Repository, consists of arandom sample of 748 donors. Your task will be to predict if a blood donor will donate within a giventime window. You will look at the full model-building process: from inspecting the dataset to usingthe tpot library to automate your Machine Learning pipeline.To complete this Project, you need to know some Python, pandas, and logistic regression.
